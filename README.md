# Laravel-Data-Views
Experimenting with multiple, simple views of data from a database.

As I've just created this repository, there is nothing too exciting here yet.

There's a list view, a grid view and a table view. 

At this point, this repository is simply for my own back-up purposes, but I've left it public because, eh, why the hell not, right?

Let it be known that I am still quite new to coding with Laravel, so this code is all very basic stuff.... for the moment.
